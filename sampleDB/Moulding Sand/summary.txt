Green strength

The list of general principles of molding sand includes green, dry, and hot strength. The sand must have strength to resist erosion, and also the metallostatic pressure of the molten metal. The mold must be permeable, i.e. to permit the gases to pass off.

The most importantcharacteristic of a molding sand is that it facilitate the economic production of good castings. The sand must have strength to resist erosion, and also the metallostaticpressure of the molten metal. The mold must be permeable, i.e. to permit the gases to pass off, or the casting will contain gas holes. It should respond to molding processes and should be reusable.
